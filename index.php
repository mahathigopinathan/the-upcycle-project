            What is The Upcycle Project?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Upcycle Project is a creative network to showcase and discover creative works. <br>
            Users are able to illustrate the before and afters of their upcycling projects, and increase their 
            status on a leaderboard through a point system, where greater scale projects earn more points. 
            All projects must be verified by staff on the project team, and personal identification 
            must be submitted to use for verification.
