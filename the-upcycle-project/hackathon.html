            What is The Upcycle Project?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Upcycle Project is a creative network to showcase and discover creative works. <br>
            Users are able to illustrate the before and afters of their upcycling projects, and increase their 
            status on a leaderboard through a point system. Every project is equivalent to 5 points added to a 
            user's score! Have fun!
    
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Our Goal
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our primary goal is to motivate and encourage sustainability. Incredibly large amounts of clothing go to waste each year, and by promoting upcycling, we hope to spread the ideas of using creativity and innovation to reuse and recycle. We encourage users to spread the word to their friends and show off their latest projects!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
            What's in it for you? 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Through the leaderboard, users will be able to see the top upcyclers within our community. Those who have earned the most points today, as well as the users with the most points this month will be available to view. At the end of each month, the 3 users who have earned the most points during that month will be rewarded with a $25 gift card to Michael's, allowing them to replenish supplies to continue upcycling! :)
